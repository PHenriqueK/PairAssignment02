##The Effect of Airbnb's Market Entry on Hotels in Berlin: A Regression Discontinuity Approach.

### Project Background

This repository contains the material for the Second Pair Assignment in Introduction to Collaborative Social Science Data Analysis (MPP-E1180) @HSoG Berlin. We provide a first draft for the research proposal of our final project. In our paper, we will seek to illustrate the magnitude of the "Airbnb effect" on hotels in Berlin, using a Regression Discontinuity Model (RDM). While some literature does exist on the impact on rents since Airbnb's entry into Berlin, literature on the effect of Airbnb on hotels is quite limited.
