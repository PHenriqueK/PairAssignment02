The second pair assignment is a proposal for your Collaborative Research Project. It is an opportunity for you to layout your research paper question and methodology, basic literature review (properly cited using BibTeX), and identify data sources that you can access to help answer your question. You will also demonstrate your understanding of literate programming technologies. Deadline: 28 October, 2,000 words maximum, 10% of final grade.

The assignment calls for: justifying why the topic of study is interesting, providing a basic literature review (properly cited using BibTeX), and identify data sources/methodologies that you can access to help answer your question. Next the task calls for clearly identifying and citing your intended data sources, and describing what format the data is currently in and how you intend to clean it up so that it is usable for statistical analysis. Lastly, given the data and research question, we are asked to answer what types of descriptive and inferential statistical are appropriate and feasible for you to answer your question (be as specific as possible including possibly looking up R functions and packages that implement these statistics.
